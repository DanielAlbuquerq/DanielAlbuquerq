 "Hey There!" \o/ ðŸ‘‹
My name is Daniel Mendes and I'm from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I'm a person who likes to expand and explore my imagination and bring it to the technology world, I like to learn from different perspectives and share experiences. I'm working and studying as a Full Stack Developer.    

Currently, I'm doing personal projects to acquire more skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, React.js, and bootstrap to write well-structured code and customize website and mobile websites for a better User Experience. 

Curiosities about me:

:rocket:I'm a fast learner.  
:open_file_folder:I'm a big fan of W3schools and Stackoverflow.  
:computer:I learned English by myself on Youtube's Channels.
